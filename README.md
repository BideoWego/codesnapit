# CodeSnapIt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BideoWego/codesnapit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BideoWego/codesnapit)

Share snap shots of your beautiful code! See the live application [here](http://codesnapit.herokuapp.com/activities)!

## Overview

CodeSnapIt was inspired by the inability to share syntax-highlighted code across social media without taking screenshots and jumping through hoops. Currently, CodeSnapIt is a fully self-contained social media site for sharing code, commenting and liking on that code, and following users.

### The Lifecycle of a SnapIt

Info coming soon!

### Other Notable Tech

Some of the more interesting parts of the project included:

- Tagging using [At.js](http://ichord.github.io/At.js/)
- [Searchable concern](https://github.com/BideoWego/codesnapit/blob/master/app/models/concerns/searchable.rb) to share across multiple models
- Using Gravatar as a [profile image](https://github.com/BideoWego/codesnapit/blob/master/app/models/profile.rb) option
- Custom controller methods for [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
- [Slugified](https://github.com/Slicertje/Slugify) user profile links

## Team

CodeSnapIt was the final [Viking Code School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/) project for [Chris Scavello](https://github.com/BideoWego) ([blog](http://bideowego.com)) and [Justin Mullis](https://github.com/nonadmin) ([blog](http://nightiron.com/)) who were the primary authors. [Sia Karamalegos](https://github.com/siakaramalegos) ([portfolio](http://siakaramalegos.github.io/)), another Viking student, contributed on a smaller scale to experience Agile development on a small team.
